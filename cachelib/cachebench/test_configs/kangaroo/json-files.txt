The Json files here allow for testing configurations of SA and Kangaroo
without a trace file. The incoming stream is generated from fixed
size and popularity distributions.

Here are some terms that are different from the paper:
- Navy = Flash Cache
- BigHash = SA

The most important things to change based on your setup are:

1. "nvmCachePaths": The location of the block device to run the cache on
2. "cacheSizeMB": The size of the in-memory cache
3. "nvmCacheSizeMB": The size of the on-flash cache
4. "writeAmpDeviceList": Where to read device-level WA if applicable

Currently both configurations create an in-memory file to back
the flash cache. This means your machine needs at least 9 GB
of free memory. 

To change the request generation length or number of keys

1. "numOps": number of operations to generate
2. "numKeys": number of keys in generated requests

"numOps" and "numKeys" are currently set to allow you to test
the setup works quickly (<10 minutes). To get accurate comparisons, 
we recommend using a trace. If a trace is not available, 
"numOps" should be set higher and the combination should
be tested to ensure the miss ratio is in a reasonable range.

Important Kangaroo parameters

1. "navyKangarooLogThreshold": Kangaroo threshold
2. "navyKangarooLogSizePct": KLog percent of flash
3. "navyKangarooLogPhysicalPartitions": number of KLog partitions
4. "navyKangarooLogIndexPerPhysicalPartitions": number of KLog index tables

More parameters can be found at `cachelib.org` under Cachebench parameters.
